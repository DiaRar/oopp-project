## Opening (_5 min_)

- Opening by chair (_1 min_)
- Check-in: How is everyone doing? (_2 min_)
  - Everyone doing fine
- Approval of the agenda - Does anyone have any additions? (_2 min_)
  - Rareș proposed we remove the reset of merge approval after a new commit, we tried but it is set impossible by teachers

## Points of action (_30-35 min_)

- Announcements by the TA (_5 min_)
  - On Friday we will have the deadline for the buddycheck. There is a example 
  on Brightspace about buddycheck. 
  - Next week we wonțt have a meeting, any questions we can ask on mattermost.
  
  - All work done in week 5 will be contribuited to week 6 as week 5 is an exam week and we donțt have knock-out criterias.
  
  - We will get a feedback at the end of this week from the TA. 
  - Week 2 doesn't count for knock-out.
  
  - Week 3 knock-out was a bit messed up: If it said you failed because merge request it might be because you didnțt approve a merge 
  request, not because you didn't open one. 
  - If you have 2 accounts on git, you need to repair to one till week 6 because after this only one 
  account will be checked.
- Talking Points: (Inform/ brainstorm/ decision making/ discuss)
  - Discuss the progress of the project (_5 min_)
    - We discussed and showed the TA what everybody did last week.
  - Discuss personal experiences with tasks and coding (_10 min_)
    - How was the task distribution?
      - The tasks were distributed nicely and this week we will switch so everybody gets a chance to work on front-end and back-end
    - Did you meet unexpected hurdles and how did you overcome them?
      - Blago met a hurdle because his work depended on the task of others so he couldn't finish his work
      till the other person finished
  - Discuss what needs to be done next (_10 min_)
    - Come up with tasks that were missing last week (_2 min_)
      - We didn't do some pages and still have some endpoints to finish
    - What relies on said tasks? (_1 min_)
      - There is still some dependencies between some endpoints
    - Work division and deadlines (_7 min_)
      - Cristian - Invitation page
      - Jerzy - Starting connection between front-end and back-end
      - Blago - Works on debt endpoint

## Closure (_5-10 min_)

- Feedback round: What went well and what can be improved next time? (_5 min_)
