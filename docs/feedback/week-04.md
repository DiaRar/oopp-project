# Meeting Feedback - Group 12

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was shared with the TA sufficiently ahead of the meeting. It followed the template provided by the course and the individual points of action/discussion were clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The previous minute taker took a decent amount of notes, though they seem quite short for a meeting of 45 mins. Consider writing things more concretely. For example, when you divide the tasks, you just mention who will work on backend or frontend, but not the tasks they will work on concretely. The notes contain what agreements you discussed during the meeting, but not what you actually ended up agreeing on. Perhaps, in future notes, consider summarizing a bit less and including more details, so after the meeting it's still clear what you meant in the notes.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair ensured that all the topics of the agenda were covered, with appropiate timing for each, and ensured that everyone was involved in the meeting discussions. He also accustomed for new topics requested to be discussed during the meeting, managing the time accordingly.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting very well. Mostly everyone was active in the meeting and engaged in productive discussions out of their own volition, though some engaged very little unless directly asked something. The overall athmosphere was constructive. For future meetings, strive to have everyone involved.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The team presented the current state of the their application, with good progress made from last week. Nice job! Perhaps, try to not leave your MRs till last minute Sunday, so you have time to review and approve them and have as much of the working functionality merged by the end of the sprint.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: The students discussed the action list of last week, and also the plan of this week. The chairman held a standup where everybody presented what they worked on last week and made sure everybody was on track. However,  not everyone managed to reach their goals for the week. In the future, before you distribute the tasks, try to figure out which tasks are interconnected or dependent on others and distribute them accordingly such that you don't have to wait on each other to finish your own work. Also, if you know a person will be unavailable for a bit, strive to have their code functioning and merged before they become unavailable such that it wouldn't delay team progress.
