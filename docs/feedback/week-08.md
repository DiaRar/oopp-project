# Meeting feedback - Group 12


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The agenda was not shared with the TA before the meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The previous minute taker took a great amount of notes, with good detail. There was also a task distribution from the previous week, but there was none with the distribution of that week. Consider including it in the minute notes of this week, but other than this, great job!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair ensured that all the topics of the agenda were covered, with appropiate timing for each, and ensured that everyone was involved in the meeting discussions. He also accustomed for new topics requested to be discussed during the meeting, and made sure to bring the discussion back to the main points whenever it was straying unproductively, managing the time accordingly.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting very well. Everyone was active in the meeting and engaged in productive discussions out of their own volition. The overall athmosphere was very nice and constructive. Keep it up!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team presented the current state of their application, with good progress made. There was a great deal of functionality merged into main this week, however, a lot of functionality wasn't properly working (e.g., the tags, the translation). I'm not sure if you merged despite it not working in order to fulfill the weekly knock-out criterias, but in the future, try not to merge features that don't fully work into the stable version of the app.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark : Very Good

Feedback: The students discussed the action list of last week, and also the plan of this week. The chairman held a standup where everybody presented what they worked on last week and made sure everybody was on track.
