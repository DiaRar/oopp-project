# Meeting Feedback - Group 12

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was shared with the TA sufficiently ahead of the meeting. It followed the template provided by the course and the individual points of action/discussion were clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The previous minute taker took a good amount of notes, though they seem somewhat short for a meeting of 45 mins. Consider writing things more concretely. Also good inclusion of the task distribution for the week!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair ensured that all the topics of the agenda were covered, with appropiate timing for each, and ensured that everyone was involved in the meeting discussions. He also accustomed for new topics requested to be discussed during the meeting, and made sure to bring the discussion back to the main points whenever it was straying unproductively, managing the time accordingly.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting very well. Everyone was active in the meeting and engaged in productive discussions out of their own volition. The overall athmosphere was very nice and constructive. Keep it up!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The team presented the current state of their application, with good progress made! I also saw a lot of other features in other branches that are not yet finished; looking forward to playing around with those at the end of this week for the Implemented Features rubric feedback!


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The students discussed the action list of last week, and also the plan of this week. The chairman held a standup where everybody presented what they worked on last week and made sure everybody was on track.
